# People First Design

**WARNING! THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE. This repo is simply guidelines to have a People First Design!**

People First Design is a simple idea: **build websites and apps for humans first, not clicks, tricks, or dark patterns**.
This is an open, community-driven guideline for developers, designers, and indie builders who want to create experiences that feel respectful, clear, and genuinely pleasant to use.
You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to try.
When I say "your creation", I mean your creation, your project, whatever it is. It could be an app, a website or a program.

## What this is

* A set of **human-friendly design principles**
* Practical guidelines you can actually follow
* Examples of good and bad patterns
* A lightweight verification badge

## What this is NOT

* Not anti-money or anti-business
* Not anti-ads (just anti-bad ads)
* Not a legal standard
* Not a way to shame other developers

## Core Principles

### 1. UX before metrics, and far before profits
Think of your creation in the shoes of someone using it. If you use your creation and actively think that it is a well-made project, easy to use, and a 5-star rated product, then you are following this principle. Your creation cannot favour metrics and profits over your users' experience. This does not mean "UX until it impacts profits", it means that you are devoted to keeping UX ahead as long as your creation is not in the negatives. As in, you should be able to go into the negatives without switching up. You can disregard this principle if and only when you have lost a lot of money suddenly, or you are continuing to lose money over a long period of time. After you make a comeback, you must go back to being UX first. 

As a wise person once said, "if you wouldn't show it to your grandma, don't do it at all". 

### 2. No dark patterns

No tricks. No guilt buttons. No fake urgency. No confusing opt-outs. No scams. No random data collection for absolutely no reason. Do not promote, create or include any illegal or unethical content, such as promoting cyberbullying or allowing rule-breaking UGC to exist on your creation.
If a user would feel annoyed after realising what happened, don’t do it.

### 3. Top Tier Privacy

Collect the **minimum data required** for your site to work.
If you don’t need it, don’t collect it.

Explain data use in plain language. Not lawyer soup.
Make sure to follow as many privacy laws as you can, and allow anyone who can prove it be able to request a deletion of their data.

### 4. Respect attention

Don’t hijack attention with popups, auto-playing audio, or endless nags.
Interrupt users only when it truly matters, such as cookie consent or legal document updates.

### 5. Clarity over cleverness

Clear text beats clever copy.
Obvious buttons beat sneaky ones.
Users should never feel dumb for not understanding your UI.

## Ads Policy

Ads are allowed — **within reason**.

People First ads must:

* Be clearly labelled as ads
* Never mimic system messages or buttons
* Never block core content
* Never track users excessively

Good examples:

* One ad on a blog page
* A sponsor section
* Optional promoted content

Bad examples:

* Fake download buttons
* Full-screen popups on load
* Ads that follow the cursor
* Required to view the ad to access the creation or receive information.

---

## Data & Privacy Guidelines

* Say **what you collect**
* Say **why you collect it**
* Say **who you share it with** (if anyone)
* Allow users to request deletion of data you control

If data comes from third parties, be honest about that too.

Plain language > legal jargon.

---

## UX & Interface Rules

* No misleading buttons
* No forced sign-ups to access basic content
* No countdown timers that reset
* No pretending something is required when it isn’t

If a user asks: “Wait… what just happened?” — rethink the design.

## Examples

You can view examples by going to `/examples` and finding the one you need.
